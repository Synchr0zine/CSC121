When the program is run, it is going to generate a menu

1.Sphere
2.Cube
3.Cylinder
4.Cone
5.Prism (Rectangular,Box)
6.Quit

For the shape chosen, output the volume and the surface area, it will then display the menu again until the user quits.

Rule 1 :If a bad value is entered (8 on the menu, or something not a number), program gives an error message and makes
the user re-enter value, same goes with the dimensions of the shape too.

Rule 2 : Program must have a seperate function to calculate the volume (eg, sphereVolume, shpereSurface, cubeVolume,
cubeSurface)
